# The prebuilt Java object YetToYes2.jar is included.
# Building it from source would require the Android build-tools and API.
# It is not worth the big effort to package those for Debian.
# To just include the prebuilt object is a practical solution.

# Several minified Javascript objects are included.
# Upstream did this intentionally.
# There is several minifiers, like YUI, Uglify.JS, and others.
# Each of them employs their own algorithms to makes the source smaller.
# Upstream included the minified versions provided by the developers.
# This way they are more sure to have well-tested and reliable minified objects.

# The lintian warning about a watch file in this native package is overriden.
# This is because this watch file will indicate whether to create a new Debian native version.
# The Debian native version is derived from the tarball that the watchfile watches.
# So it is important to have this watchfile.
# That is why it is overridden here.
