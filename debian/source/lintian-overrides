# The prebuilt Java object YetToYes2.jar is included.
# Building it from source would require the Android build-tools and API.
# It is not worth the big effort to package those for Debian.
# To just include the prebuilt object is a practical solution.

# Several minified Javascript objects are included.
# Upstream did this intentionally.
# There is several minifiers, like YUI, Uglify.JS, and others.
# Each of them employs their own algorithms to makes the source smaller.
# Upstream included the minified versions provided by the developers.
# This way they are more sure to have well-tested and reliable minified objects.

# For just now the mbed TLS library is included.
# When using the system-provided libmbedtls, there currently is a segmentation fault.
# Pending investigation of this fault, temporarily include mbed TLS.
# Here is the link to the issue: https://github.com/bibledit/bibledit/issues/499
# By the way, isn't it called "mbed" TLS, obviously intended to be "embedded"?
# So Bibledit is doing that right now, it "embeds" mbed TLS.
